            <small>Last modified: February 1, 2014</small>
            <h3>Welcome to GraphHopper</h3>
            Thanks for using our products and services!                       

            The purpose of this website, <a href="http://graphhopper.com">graphhopper.com</a> (the "Site"), owned and operated by Peter Karich
            is to provide routing products and services. At <a href="http://graphhopper.com/maps">graphhopper.com/maps</a> ("GraphHopper Maps") 
            driving directions are provided. Additionally routing Web API(s) ("Web API(s)") are offered.
            <br/><br/>
            By using the Site, the Web API(s), GraphHopper Maps or any services provided on the Site (collectively, "Services"), 
            you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the following 
            terms of service and any future modifications to this agreement (collectively, the "Terms").
            If at any time you do not agree to all these Terms, please immediately terminate your use of the 
            Services. You, on your own behalf and on behalf of your company, acknowledge that these Terms 
            are binding and enforceable on you and your company (collectively, "You" or "Subscriber").                        
            
            <h3>Using our Services</h3>

            You must adhere to all policies posted within the Services and 
            all accompanying documentation. All such policies are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms.
            <br/><br/>

            In order to use the Web API(s) you must agree to the Terms. You can accept the Terms by:
            <br/>
            (a) clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this option is made available to you by Peter Karich in the user 
            interface for the Service; or
            <br/>
            (b) using the Web API(s). In this case, you understand and agree that Peter Karich will treat your use of the Web API(s) 
            as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.
            <br/><br/>

            You represent that you have full power, capacity and authority to accept these Terms. If you are accepting on 
            behalf of your employer or another entity, you represent that you have full legal authority to bind your 
            employer or such entity to these Terms. If you don't have the legal authority to bind, please ensure that an
            authorized person from your entity consents to and accepts these Terms.
            <br/><br/>

            For information about GraphHoppers's data protection practices, please read GraphHopper's
            <a href="./privacy.html">privacy policy</a>.
            <br/><br/>
            As a condition of your use of the Services, you warrant to Peter Karich that
            you will not use the Services for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these terms, 
            conditions, or notices. You may not use the Services in any manner which could damage, disable, 
            overburden, or impair the Services or interfere with any other party's use and enjoyment of the Services. 
            Recognizing the global nature of the Internet, you agree to comply with all local rules regarding online 
            conduct and acceptable content.
            <br/><br/>

            You agree that Peter Karich is not responsible for the calculated routes and does not provide warranty
            for damages of any kind. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Peter Karich and its subsidiaries, 
            affiliates, officers, agents, 
            partners, and employees from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any 
            third party due to or arising out of content you submit, post to, or transmit through the Services, your 
            use of the Services, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any rights of another.
            <br/><br/>

            The Site allows you to access and view a variety of content, including but not limited to routing and
            map data, and other related information provided by Peter Karich and its licensors. 
            You understand and agree to the following with respect to all content made available by or through the Site:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You understand that map data and related content are provided for planning purposes only.
                    You may find that events may cause the actual information to differ from the map results.
                    You should exercise judgment in your use of all content made available by or through the Site.
                </li>

                    Certain content is provided under license from third parties, and is subject to copyright and other 
                    intellectual property rights owned by or licensed to such third parties. 
                    You may be held liable for any unauthorized copying or disclosure of this content. 
                    You understand that when using the Site you will be exposed to user submissions and other third party content 
                    from a variety of sources ("Non-GraphHopper Content"), and that you may be exposed to Non-GraphHopper 
                    Content that is inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable. Peter Karich does not 
                    endorse any Non-GraphHopper Content or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein. Under 
                    no circumstances will Peter Karich be liable in any way for or in connection with the Non-GraphHopper Content,
                    including, but not limited to, for any inaccuracies, errors, or omissions in any Non-GraphHopper Content, 
                    any intellectual property infringement with regard to any Non-GraphHopper Content, or for any loss or 
                    damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Non-GraphHopper Content posted, emailed, or 
                    otherwise displayed or transmitted through the Site.
                </li>
            </ul>

            Peter Karich reserves all rights not expressly granted to you. The use of the Site, including its software, 
            services, maps, and other content, is licensed only to you and may not be transferred to anyone without the prior 
            written consent of Peter Karich. Any authorized transferee shall agree in writing to be bound by the terms and 
            conditions of these Terms. In no event may you copy, loan, rent, time-share, sublicense, assign, transfer, lease, 
            sell or otherwise dispose of the Site's software, maps, or other content on a temporary or permanent basis except 
            as expressly provided herein.
            <br/><br/>
            These Terms shall benefit Peter Karich and its successors and assigns. You may not, or permit any third party to, 
            modify, adapt, translate, create derivative works from, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise 
            attempt to derive any source code from the Site's software. All logos and product names appearing on or in 
            connection with the Site are proprietary to Peter Karich or its licensors and/or suppliers. You agree never to 
            remove any proprietary notices or product identification labels from the Site's software, maps, and other content, 
            if applicable. The limited license granted above terminates automatically, without notice to you, if you breach any 
            of these Terms. Upon termination of the limited license, you agree to immediately destroy any downloaded or printed 
            materials from the Site, including software, maps, and other content.
            <br/><br/>

            You understand that some plans require You to display GraphHopper branding and You agree to comply with this requirement.
            <br/><br/>

            You agree to provide attribution when required, as outlined in GraphHopper documentation or as requested by Peter Karich. 
            You understand that a subscription to a GraphHopper plan that offers "branding-free routing" does not waive your 
            responsibility to provide attribution when required or requested.
            <br/><br/>

            All other materials displayed or performed on the Site, including, but not limited to text, graphics, maps, logos, 
            tools, photographs, images, illustrations, software or source code, audio and video, and animations are the 
            property of Peter Karich and/or third parties and are protected in Germany and international copyright laws.

                    Your account grants you permission to use the Site and Services, for both commercial and

                    in others.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Account Cancellation</b>.
                    Peter Karich may cancel or suspend your access to the Services for any reason by providing you thirty 
                    days advance notice. Upon cancellation or suspension, your right to use the service will stop immediately. 
                    You may not have access to data that you stored on the service after we suspend or terminate the service. 
                    You are responsible for backing-up your data that you use with the service. 
                    <br/>
                    If we cancel your service in its entirety without cause, we will refund to you on a pro-rata basis the amount 
                    of your payment corresponding to the portion of your service remaining right before we terminated your service.
                    <br/>
                    You may cancel at any time. As soon as you cancel the service your right to use it stops immediately. 
                    You may not have access to data that you stored on the service after you terminate the service. 
                    You are responsible for backing-up your data that you use with the service. 
                    Cancellation of the service by you will not alter your obligations to pay all charges due to Peter Karich at the 
                    time of cancellation.
                </li>
                <li>

                    <b>Limits</b>.
                    If your Maps API application generates a high volume of transactions, 
                    Peter Karich reserves the right to set transaction limits, as described in the Documentation here. 
                    Peter Karich also reserves the right to set other usage policies in the Documentation from time to time. 
                    If you want to engage in use outside these transaction limits or usage policies, please contact the 
                    Peter Karich for information on licensing options to address your needs.
                </li>
                <li><b>Your Implementation</b>.                    
                    If you develop a Web API(s) Implementation for use by other users, you must:
                    <br/>
                    (a) attribute GraphHopper and also OpenStreetMap if you use this data;
                    <br/>
                    (b) display to the users of your Web API(s) Implementation the link to this GraphHopper's Terms of
                    Services as presented through the Service or described in the Web API(s) Documentation;
                    <br/>
                    (c) explicitly state in your Web API(s) Implementation's terms of use that, by using your Web API(s) 
                    Implementation, your users are agreeing to be bound by GraphHopper's Terms of Use; and
                    <br/>
                    (d) protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. 
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Charges & Payment</h3>

            Some of the Services require payment of fees.

            Peter Karich is not responsible for any additional bank fees, interest charges, finance charges, over draft 
            charges, or other fees resulting from charges billed by Peter Karich. Currency exchange settlements will be 
            based on agreements between you and the provider of your credit card.

            All charges are non-refundable unless expressly stated otherwise, or otherwise provided by applicable law. 
            The costs of any returns if permitted will be at your expense, unless otherwise provided by applicable law.

            You may cancel at any time. There is no required length of time associated with using the Services, 
            but we do not give pro-rated refunds for unused time if cancellation is initiated during the middle of a 
            billing cycle.

            We reserve the right to change our fees, but will notify you in advance of increases.

            <h3>Modifying and Terminating our Services</h3>

            We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we 
            may suspend or stop a Service altogether.

            You can stop using our Services at any time, although we’ll be sorry to see you go. Peter Karich may also stop 
            providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.

            We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data is important. If we discontinue a 
            Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information 
            out of that Service. 

            <h3>Our Warranties and Disclaimers</h3>
            We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy 
            using them. But there are certain things that we don’t promise about our Services.<br/>

            OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS, NEITHER PETER KARICH NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR 
            DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON’T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT 
            THE CONTENT WITHIN THE SERVICES, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE SERVICES, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, 
            OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES “AS IS”.

            SOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES. 

            <h3>Limitation of Liability and Damages</h3>

            YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, PETER KARICH, ITS 
            SUBSIDIARIES, AND AFFILIATES, AND PETER KARICH'S LICENSORS AND THEIR SUPPLIERS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR:
            <br/><br/>
            (a) ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU,
            HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY (INCLUDING, BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO: CONTRACT, TORT, COMMON LAW, 
            OR STATUTORY DAMAGES; ANY LOSS OF PROFIT (WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY), ANY LOSS OF GOODWILL OR 
            BUSINESS REPUTATION, ANY LOSS OF DATA, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE 
            LOSS); OR<br/><br/>

            (b) ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE AS A RESULT OF:<br/>
            (i) ANY RELIANCE PLACED BY YOU ON THE COMPLETENESS, ACCURACY OR EXISTENCE OF ANY ROUTING RESULTS, 
            OR AS A RESULT OF ANY RELATIONSHIP OR TRANSACTION BETWEEN YOU AND THE SERVICES;<br/>
            (ii) ANY CHANGES THAT PETER KARICH MAY MAKE TO THE SERVICE, OR ANY PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY CESSATION IN THE 
            PROVISION OF THE SERVICE (OR ANY FEATURES WITHIN THE SERVICE);<br/>
            (iii) THE DELETION OF, CORRUPTION OF, OR FAILURE TO STORE, ANY CONTENT AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS DATA MAINTAINED 
            OR TRANSMITTED BY OR THROUGH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE;<br/>
            (iv) YOUR FAILURE TO PROVIDE PETER KARICH WITH ACCURATE ACCOUNT INFORMATION; OR<br/>
            (v) YOUR FAILURE TO KEEP YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT DETAILS SECURE AND CONFIDENTIAL.
            <br/><br/>
            THE LIMITATIONS ON PETER KARICH'S LIABILITY TO YOU IN THIS TERMS WILL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT PETER KARICH, 
            ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, LICENSORS OR THEIR SUPPLIERS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF 
            THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES.

            <h3>About These Terms</h3>

            We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes 
            to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of 
            modifications to these terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable 
            Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after 
            they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons 
            will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue 
            your use of that Service.
            <br/><br/>

            If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict.
            These terms control the relationship between Peter Karich and You. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.
            If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any 
            rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).            
            If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.
            <br/><br/>

            The laws of Bavaria, Germany, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services.
